# Expert-based heuristic policies

To find the best expert-based heuristic policy, one must conduct a search over the possible inspection intervals and number of component to be inspected.

This is done via the [run_heuristics](run_heuristics.py) script.

This script takes as input via its first lines the parameters of the environments and the parameters of the heuristic search.

Execute the script `download_heuristic_logs.sh` to retrieve the logs of the experiments conducted in the paper.
